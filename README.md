Welcome to my ToDoList app 🤗 This app will help you to make a list of things you have to do . You can set priority for your tasks , and the app will show each task's priority by different color ( red 🔴: has the highest priority and you must do red tasks sooner than others , orage 🟠 : after red tasks orenge ones have higher priority and must be done , green 🟢 : tasks with the lowest periority will be shown in green color ). If you check a task ( when you done it ) it will be shown in gray . Nothing will be removed from list before you press the recyclebin button in front of it . Notice that you can see description , date and time for each task when you press on its label. 😎🤐
